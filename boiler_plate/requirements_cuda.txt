# FFmpeg CUDA Processor Requirements
# Core dependencies for GPU-accelerated media processing

# No external Python dependencies required - uses only standard library
# However, system dependencies are required:

# System Requirements:
# 1. FFmpeg with CUDA support
# 2. NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability
# 3. NVIDIA drivers
# 4. CUDA toolkit (optional but recommended)

# Installation commands for different systems:

# Ubuntu/Debian:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install ffmpeg nvidia-driver-xxx cuda-toolkit

# macOS (with Homebrew):
# brew install ffmpeg
# Note: CUDA support on macOS is limited

# Windows:
# Download FFmpeg with CUDA support from official builds
# Install NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit

# Verify installation:
# ffmpeg -version | grep cuda
# nvidia-smi
